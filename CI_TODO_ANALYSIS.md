# CI/CD Pipeline TODO Analysis

## Summary

This document outlines the current state of the CI/CD pipeline and identifies areas that need attention. Several steps use `continue-on-error: true` to allow the pipeline to pass despite failures. These should be addressed and removed once the underlying issues are fixed.

## Critical Items (continue-on-error usage)

### 1. **Coverage Reports (All Backend Services + Live Chat)**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`

- **Services affected:** backend_database, backend_gamelogic, live-chat
- **Issue:** Coverage report generation uses `continue-on-error: true`
- **Why temporary:** Coverage thresholds may not be properly configured yet
- **Action needed:**
  1. Configure coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts for each service
  2. Ensure tests meet the threshold
  3. Remove `continue-on-error` flag
- **Priority:** Medium (Tests pass, but coverage enforcement is missing)

### 2. **Frontend Tests**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`

- **Services affected:** frontend
- **Issue:** `npm test` uses `continue-on-error: true`
- **Why temporary:** Frontend package.json has NO test script defined
- **Action needed:**
  1. Add test framework to frontend (e.g., vitest, jest, or playwright)
  2. Write frontend tests
  3. Add "test" script to frontend/package.json
  4. Remove `continue-on-error` flag
- **Priority:** High (No frontend testing at all)

## Security & Quality Warnings

### 3. **Rate Limiting Missing**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** backend_database
- **Issue:** No rate limiting middleware detected
- **Action needed:**
  1. Install @fastify/rate-limit
  2. Configure rate limiting in backend_database/src/main.ts
  3. Add appropriate limits for different endpoints
- **Priority:** High (Security vulnerability)

### 4. **Helmet Security Headers Missing**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** live-chat
- **Issue:** Helmet security headers not configured
- **Action needed:**
  1. Install @fastify/helmet
  2. Register helmet plugin in live-chat/src/main.ts
  3. Configure appropriate security headers
- **Priority:** Medium (Security best practice)

### 5. **WebSocket Authentication**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** backend_gamelogic
- **Issue:** WebSocket handlers may lack proper authentication
- **Action needed:**
  1. Review backend_gamelogic WebSocket handlers
  2. Implement authentication middleware for WebSocket connections
  3. Verify JWT tokens before establishing WebSocket connections
- **Priority:** High (Security vulnerability)

### 6. **NPM Audit Vulnerabilities**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** All services with npm dependencies
- **Issue:** Pipeline warns but doesn't fail on npm audit vulnerabilities
- **Action needed:**
  1. Run `npm audit` locally in each service
  2. Fix high/critical vulnerabilities with `npm audit fix`
  3. Review and update dependencies as needed
  4. Consider making this step fail the build
- **Priority:** High (Security vulnerabilities)

### 7. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** Potentially all TypeScript services
- **Issue:** TypeScript compilation warnings don't fail the build
- **Action needed:**
  1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` in each service locally
  2. Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
  3. Make the CI step fail on TypeScript errors
- **Priority:** Medium (Code quality issue)

### 8. **Docker Security - Non-root Users**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Services affected:** All services with Dockerfiles
- **Issue:** Dockerfiles may be running as root user
- **Action needed:**
  1. Add USER directive to each Dockerfile
  2. Create a non-root user in each container
  3. Ensure proper file permissions
- **Priority:** Medium (Security best practice)

### 9. **Missing .dockerignore**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Issue:** No .dockerignore file in repository
- **Action needed:**
  1. Create .dockerignore in repository root
  2. Exclude node_modules, .git, .env, test files, etc.
  3. Reduce Docker image sizes and build times
- **Priority:** Low (Performance optimization)

### 10. **Environment Variable Placeholders**

**Location:** `.github/workflows/security-quality.yml`

- **Issue:** .env.example may contain real-looking values instead of placeholders
- **Action needed:**
  1. Review .env.example
  2. Replace any real-looking values with clear placeholders
  3. Use formats like "your_secret_here" or "CHANGE_ME"
- **Priority:** Low (Documentation/security hygiene)

## Pipeline Structure

The CI pipeline runs in the following order:

1. **secrets-check** - Validates no secrets are committed
2. **unit-tests** (parallel with security-quality after secrets-check)
3. **security-quality** (parallel with unit-tests after secrets-check)
4. **integration-tests** - Runs after unit-tests and security-quality pass
5. **ci-success** - Final validation of all jobs

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before removing continue-on-error)

1. ✅ Add frontend tests (Priority: High)
2. ✅ Implement rate limiting in backend_database (Priority: High)
3. ✅ Add WebSocket authentication to backend_gamelogic (Priority: High)
4. ✅ Fix npm audit vulnerabilities (Priority: High)

### Short-term Actions

1. Configure coverage thresholds for all services
2. Add Helmet to live-chat service
3. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
4. Add non-root users to Dockerfiles

### Long-term Actions

1. Create .dockerignore file
2. Review and clean up .env.example
3. Consider adding e2e tests
4. Set up coverage reporting/badges

## Notes

- All `continue-on-error: true` flags are **TEMPORARY** and should be removed once underlying issues are fixed
- The warnings in security-quality checks should eventually become hard failures
- Integration tests are comprehensive and properly fail on errors
- The CI pipeline structure is well-organized with proper job dependencies
