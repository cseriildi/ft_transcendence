# Refresh Token Cookie - Test Results Summary

## ✅ BACKEND IS WORKING CORRECTLY

All comprehensive tests confirm that the refresh token cookie functionality is working as expected in the backend.

## Test Results

### Automated Tests (vitest)
```bash
npm test -- refresh-token-debug.test.ts
```
**Result**: ✅ All 7 tests PASSED
- Cookie is set on registration with correct properties
- Cookie value matches database hash
- Cookie is set on login
- Refresh endpoint accepts valid cookie
- Refresh endpoint rejects missing cookie
- Logout properly revokes token
- Cookie properties are correct (httpOnly, path, sameSite, etc.)

### Diagnostic Tool
```bash
npx tsx diagnose-refresh-token.ts
```
**Result**: ✅ All checks PASSED
- Registration sets cookie ✅
- Cookie stored in database ✅
- Refresh with cookie works ✅
- Refresh without cookie fails correctly ✅
- Logout revokes token ✅

## What's Confirmed Working

1. **Cookie Setting**:
   - ✅ Refresh token cookie is set on `/auth/register`
   - ✅ Refresh token cookie is set on `/auth/login`
   - ✅ New refresh token cookie is set on `/auth/refresh`

2. **Cookie Properties**:
   - ✅ `httpOnly: true` (prevents JavaScript access)
   - ✅ `path: '/auth'` (only sent to /auth/* endpoints)
   - ✅ `sameSite: 'Lax'` (CSRF protection)
   - ✅ `maxAge: 604800000` (7 days)
   - ✅ `secure: false` in dev, `true` in production

3. **Database Storage**:
   - ✅ Token is hashed with bcrypt before storage
   - ✅ Cookie value matches database hash
   - ✅ JTI (JWT ID) properly links cookie to database
   - ✅ Tokens are properly revoked on logout

4. **Security**:
   - ✅ Invalid tokens are rejected
   - ✅ Missing cookies are rejected
   - ✅ Tokens are rotated on refresh (old deleted, new created)
   - ✅ Logout marks token as revoked

## Frontend Issue: "No refresh token provided"

Since the backend is confirmed working, the issue is in the frontend. Here are the **most likely causes**:

### 1. Missing `credentials: 'include'` ⚠️ MOST COMMON

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Cookie won't be sent
fetch('http://localhost:4200/auth/refresh', {
  method: 'POST'
})

// ✅ CORRECT - Cookie will be sent
fetch('http://localhost:4200/auth/refresh', {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include'  // <-- THIS IS REQUIRED!
})
```

### 2. Wrong URL Path ⚠️ SECOND MOST COMMON

Cookie is set with `path: '/auth'`, so it's ONLY sent to URLs starting with `/auth`:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Cookie won't be sent (path doesn't match)
fetch('http://localhost:4200/refresh', ...)

// ❌ WRONG - Cookie won't be sent (path doesn't match)  
fetch('http://localhost:4200/api/refresh', ...)

// ✅ CORRECT - Cookie will be sent
fetch('http://localhost:4200/auth/refresh', ...)
```

### 3. CORS Configuration

Your backend already has correct CORS:
```typescript
cors: {
  origin: 'http://localhost:4200',
  credentials: true  // ✅ Already set
}
```

But make sure your frontend is running on `http://localhost:4200`. If it's on a different port/domain, update the CORS origin.

### 4. Proxy Configuration

If you're using a proxy (like Angular's proxy.conf.json), ensure cookies are forwarded:

```json
{
  "/auth": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": false,
    "changeOrigin": true,
    "logLevel": "debug"
  }
}
```

## How to Debug in Browser

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)

2. **Make a login request**, then check:
   - **Network tab** → Find the `/auth/login` request
   - **Response Headers** → Should see:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: refresh_token=eyJhbGc...; Path=/auth; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
     ```

3. **Check cookies are stored**:
   - **Application tab** → **Storage** → **Cookies** → `http://localhost:4200`
   - Should see: `refresh_token` with value, Path=/auth, HttpOnly=true

4. **Make a refresh request**, then check:
   - **Network tab** → Find the `/auth/refresh` request
   - **Request Headers** → Should see:
     ```
     Cookie: refresh_token=eyJhbGc...
     ```
   - If this is **MISSING**, the problem is:
     - Missing `credentials: 'include'` in fetch, OR
     - Wrong URL path (not starting with `/auth`), OR
     - Cookie domain mismatch

## Example Frontend Code (Angular)

### HTTP Interceptor (Recommended)
```typescript
// auth.interceptor.ts
import { HttpInterceptorFn } from '@angular/common/http';

export const authInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  // Clone request and add withCredentials for auth endpoints
  if (req.url.includes('/auth')) {
    req = req.clone({
      withCredentials: true  // This sends cookies!
    });
  }
  return next(req);
};
```

### Service Method
```typescript
// auth.service.ts
refreshToken(): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.post(
    'http://localhost:4200/auth/refresh',  // Note: /auth/refresh
    {},
    { withCredentials: true }  // This sends cookies!
  );
}

logout(): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.post(
    'http://localhost:4200/auth/logout',
    {},
    { withCredentials: true }
  );
}
```

## Testing Tools Provided

1. **`tests/refresh-token-debug.test.ts`** - Comprehensive automated tests
2. **`diagnose-refresh-token.ts`** - Quick diagnostic tool
3. **`test-refresh-cookie.sh`** - Bash script for manual testing
4. **`REFRESH_TOKEN_TESTING.md`** - Detailed documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Check your frontend code** for `credentials: 'include'` or `withCredentials: true`
2. **Verify the request URL** starts with `/auth/refresh` (not just `/refresh`)
3. **Use browser DevTools** to confirm cookies are being sent
4. **Check the browser console** for CORS errors
5. If still stuck, share:
   - Screenshot of Network tab showing the `/auth/refresh` request headers
   - Your frontend code making the refresh request
   - Browser console errors (if any)

## Conclusion

The backend refresh token cookie system is **100% functional and secure**. The "No refresh token provided" error is a frontend integration issue, most likely:
- Missing `credentials: 'include'`
- Wrong URL path
- CORS/proxy misconfiguration

Follow the debugging steps above to identify and fix the issue in your frontend code.
