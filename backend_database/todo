-2FA
⚠️ Backup codes: If user loses phone, they're locked out forever
⚠️ Password verification: Anyone with userId can disable 2FA currently
⚠️ Rate limiting: No protection against brute-force token guessing (1/1,000,000 chance per attempt)
⚠️ Login integration: 2FA setup exists but isn't enforced during actual login

        (optinal) add rate limiting
            Industry Best Practice for 2FA:
            Your Setup vs Production:
            Feature	Your Setup	Typical Production
                Global rate limit	✅ 5/sec per IP	✅ 100/sec per IP
                Per-user 2FA limit	❌ None	        ✅ 5 per 15 min
                Account lockout	    ❌ None	        ✅ After 5 fails
            Failed attempt logging	❌ None	        ✅ Logged + alerted
