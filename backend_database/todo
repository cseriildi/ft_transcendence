-2FA
⚠️ Backup codes: If user loses phone, they're locked out forever
⚠️ Password verification: Anyone with userId can disable 2FA currently
⚠️ Rate limiting: No protection against brute-force token guessing (1/1,000,000 chance per attempt)
⚠️ Login integration: 2FA setup exists but isn't enforced during actual login

        (optinal) add rate limiting
            Industry Best Practice for 2FA:
            Your Setup vs Production:
            Feature	Your Setup	Typical Production
                Global rate limit	✅ 5/sec per IP	✅ 100/sec per IP
                Per-user 2FA limit	❌ None	        ✅ 5 per 15 min
                Account lockout	    ❌ None	        ✅ After 5 fails
            Failed attempt logging	❌ None	        ✅ Logged + alerted

-test real Oauth for github

-Protect more routes (figure what routes should be protected how)

-Protect websocket connection -> other conatiners (chat and game) should "foreward" access tokens upon websocket conenction to DB service for authentication

-Add post routes to GameLogic to post gamescore upon completion

-Gamelogic should automatically close game and sockets on game end

-Gamelogic should extract player Ids from JWT after authentication

-Gamelogic should automatically assign players (max 2) to individual games

-update routes and DB manipulation:

    ✅ Users can securely subscribe to the website.
    ✅ Registered users can securely log in.
    ✅ Users can select a unique display name to participate in tournaments.
    ✅ Users can update their information.
    ✅ Users can upload an avatar, with a default option if none is provided.
    ✅ Users can add others as friends and view their online status. (tests missing)
    ? User profiles display stats, such as wins and losses.
    ✅ Each user has a Match History including 1v1 games, dates, and relevant
